# What is this?
This was my Year 12 major project that I created for my subject IPT (Information Processing Technology) in term 2/3 of 2018. We were tasked with creating a business application to solve a problem using relational databases and C#. My application was a checkout or POS system designed around a fictional technology business (Maximum Technology) where I programmed features such as an inventory system, login system, checkout system, manager settings forms, invoice logs and more. If I am being completely honest, it was a botched job. I knew how tidy my code was didnt matter in the grading scheme and so I botched the code to do it as fast as I could, which is why the SQL connections look so messy and why there is so many of them. 

However, thats not all! The reason I wanted to get the code done so fast was because I knew the main marking was done on the documentation. The very lengthy documentation I submitted can be found in the repo <a href="https://github.com/Wrdle/Maximum-Technology/blob/master/IPT%20Major%20Project.docx">here</a>. As part of this doucmentation, I was required to:
- I dentify the application, its purpose, universe of discourse, assumptions etc. 
- Conceptualize the application (goals, system capabilities, input & output) 
- Create conceptual schema, including database entities, elementary sentences, CSD, relational schema, UI Design and data flow diagrams
- Make changes as I create the project from my plan, documenting what has changed from its original conception
- Code and test the program documenting each
- Evaluate the program 
- Conduct a survey on the program and evaluate the survey answers
- Provide final reccomendations for next time

# Was it a success?
In my self judging opinion, yes and no. It met all the criteria of the assignment rewarding me with an A+, however, I personally think there is plenty of room for improvement. But I shouldnt expect much more from such as rushed job :/.

# What I learnt
- I learned and understood how to use Data Grid Views in Windows Forms and their event handlers
- I learned and understood how to create ORM's and gained further experience in designing relational databases
- I applied my skills in evaluation to evaluate the program and perform a survey about the program
- I learned how to plan and an application in order to solve a speicifc problem
- I furthered my experience and skills in SQL by creating more advanced and complex SQL queriers that involved complex 'JOINS'
- I learned how to test and document the testing of an application
- I furthered my knowledge in creating MS SQL connections in C#
